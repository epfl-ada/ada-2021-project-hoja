# Recognition and severity of issues asymmetries

## Abstract

In this project, we will compare the number of quotes about issues with their death toll. The background for this research is our 
belief that there is a significant asymmetry between the issues with the highest death tolls and the most spoken about issues. 
We will combine the Quotebank dataset with data from Our World in Data, which has ranked the number of deaths by cause from 1970 to 2017 (source). 
The death toll does not consider factors such as at what age people die, the fear created by e.g. a terrorist attack, and suffering without death. 
However, the death toll is still a decent indicator of the severity of most issues. The goal of this research is to learn what issues society cares 
most about and see if it correlates to the death tolls. Furthermore, the research will show which issues are neglected and hence need more attention.

## Research questions

* Is there a significant asymmetry between the issues that receive the most attention and the issues that cause most deaths?
* Does the number of quotes about an issue increase/decrease proportionally to the number of deaths per year?
* Does the average age of victims of an issue affect how much attention it receives?
* Do issues receive more/less attention based on the average GDP of the countries they affect?
* Do issues grouped into injuries, communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases receive different amounts of attention per death caused?

## Datasets

In addition to the Quotebank dataset, we will explore Our World in Data, available here: https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death. 
This dataset, is summarized from other datasources such as Global Sources of Disease (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) and Amnesty
International (https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/), contains the annual deathtolls as well as causes for each country from 
2008 to 2017. 

## Methods

In order to estimate asymmetries between media coverage and actual deathcauses, we have three main challenges.
* **Quote Categorization**: In order to extract accurate categorizations of quotes about a certain category of death, we will create an intelligent 
keyword extraction function. This will be done through ....
